<h2>Scientific Method</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Make an observation</dt>
    <dd>First, you make an observation of some phenomenon that cannot be explained fully using current knowledge. For example, scientist Robert Paine noticed that the biodiversity of an intertidal ecosystem decreased when there were fewer predators present. This observation led to what is now known as the landmark Keystone Species experiment.</dd>
    <dt>Do background research and ask a question</dt>
    <dd>Then, based on this observation and background research, you ask a question about the phenomenon that you would like to answer. A keystone species example is that Paine asked the question, "Which predator species have large effects on the biodiversity of intertidal ecosystems?" based on this observation.</dd>
    <dt>Generate a hypothesis</dt>
    <dd>At this point, you propose a hypothesis, or a testable explanation to your question. A keystone species example is that as a proposed explanation to this question, Paine hypothesized that starfish play a large role in controlling the number of species in these areas.</dd>
    <dt>Conduct an experiment</dt>
    <dd>Then, you design an experiment in order to test your hypothesis. A keystone species example is that in order to test this hypothesis, Paine set up an experiment in which he artificially removed starfish from a specific intertidal area and then measured species diversity.</dd>
    <dt>Analyze data and draw conclusions</dt>
    <dd>From this data draw conclusions about the validity of your hypothesis. If the results do not support your hypothesis, you would propose a new one and test that. Robert Paine found that, over a year, the number of species in the ecosystem decreased without starfish. Paine called species with this property 'keystone species.' This supported his hypothesis and allowed him to conclude that starfish play a large role in controlling biodiversity. He called species with this property keystone species.</dd>
