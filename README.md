# Solomon Islands curriculum, offline version

The Solomon Islands have built an [online curriculum](www.iresource.gov.sb/) for their schools. Unfortunately, it is meant to be accessed online, which is not practical for many of the schools on small, outlying islands that may have little or no connectivity.

This project is working to create a simple, offline copy of the curriculum to be loaded on a hard disk for outlying schools.

The remaining work that we need to do is:

- ~~Pre-primary year~~
- ~~Primary English~~
- ~~Primary mathematics~~
- ~~Primary readers~~
- Junior Secondary Mathematics
  - Year 7
  - Year 8
  - Year 9
- Junior Secondary Science

## FAQ

**What do I do with references to external resources?**

PDFs included in the curriculum should be downloaded, checked into the repository, and referred to with relative links in the HTML. References to PHeT simulations for science and works in Project Gutenberg in English should be left in, but without links, as both those resources can be installed offline alongside this curriculum. If there are other resources you think should be included and can do the work to figure out how to make them available offline, we would thank you.

**Can we use a prettier format?**

If you want to do the work, sure, but let's make sure we have all the content first.
