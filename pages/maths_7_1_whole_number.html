    <h3>Maths 7.1 - Whole number</h3>
        <p>Our number system uses ten digits. The position of a digit in a number determines its value. In the system of Place Value, the digits stay in their correct positions during addition and subtraction. Multiplication is the process of adding numbers in a pattern. Division is the process of sharing equally. Estimation and simplification help to make calculation easier. Operations of numbers must be performed in the correct order – BODMAS.</p>

    <summary>Questions</summary>
    <p>What did different civilizations use to record larger quantities?</p>

        <li>Roman numerals</li>
        <li>Tally marks</li>
        <li>Body parts (such as fingers)</li>
        <li>Egyptian numerals</li>
    </ol>

    <p>What is the common characteristic of early numerical systems?</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>The order or placement of the symbols used to write numbers does not matter</li>
        <li>They are positional systems</li>
        <li>They used the same symbols to represent numbers</li>
        <li>They were all base 10</li>
    </ol>

    <p>What innovation did the Roman numerals use?</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>They had many symbols for larger magnitudes</li>
        <li>They had new symbols for bigger numbers (like C for 100 and M for 1,000)</li>
        <li>Depending on their position, numerals could be added or subtracted</li>
        <li>They made it easier to write big numbers</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Which civilization developed positional notation for its numerical system?</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>The Babylonians</li>
        <li>The ancient Chinese</li>
        <li>The Aztecs</li>
        <li>The Indians</li>
        <li>All of the above</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Why was the number zero an important addition to number systems?</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>It is the final tenth symbol needed for the numeration system to be complete</li>
        <li>It is necessary to write ever bigger numbers</li>
        <li>It is useful as a value and a placeholder to keep the notation consistent</li>
        <li>It is a good symbol for “nothing”</li>
    </ol>

    <p>What other bases, besides 10, can be used to express numerical quantities?</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Base 20, and base 60</li>
        <li>Base 2, base 8, and base 16</li>
        <li>Base 12</li>
        <li>All of the above</li>
    </ol>

    <p>When are bases 2, 8, and 16 used in our daily life? (Pick 2) A When we measure time B When we program C When we measure angles D When we use our digital devices</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>A and C</li>
        <li>B and D</li>
        <li>B and C</li>
        <li>A and D</li>
    </ol>

    <p>What is the difference between additive and positional numerical systems and what are the benefits and disadvantages of using one system rather than the other? Can you think of some instances in which we still use tally marks or similar tools?</p>

    <p>The number zero is such a fascinating number that many books have been written about it. Briefly explain why it was such an important breakthrough for the number system we use today.</p>

    <p>Let’s choose a number – say 253 (in base 10). What would you do to write it in base 2 (when you only have two symbols, 0 and 1)? Or in base 5 (five symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4)?</p>

    <p>Create a new (positional) numerical system. Explain what base (other than 10) and what symbols you would choose and why. Write a few numbers in your system and their equivalent in base 10.</p>

    <p>In the English language, the word digit refers to:</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>A finger, a thumb, or a toe</li>
        <li>Any one of the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 used for writing numbers</li>
        <li>Both of the above</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The third number within a third group of twelve is 27. What is the fifth number within a fifth group of twelve?</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>53</li>
        <li>65</li>
        <li>77</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In representing the binary system on fingers, a raised first digit has the value 1, a raised second digit the value 2, a raised third digit the value 4, all the way up to a raised tenth digit having the value 512. What number is represented by raising the first, third, fifth, and sixth fingers together?</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>51</li>

    </ol>

    <p>The doubling numbers (that is, the powers of two) begin 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32... Do any of these numbers ever begin with a seven?</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>The 30th number in this list (2^29) begins with a seven</li>
        <li>The 47th number in this list (2^46) begins with a seven</li>

    <p>If one can readily bend one’s fingers into four states – down, slightly down, slightly up, and up – what is the highest number you can represent with ten fingers in a base-4 positional notational system?</p>

    <p>Although the placement of symbols now has some significance, this version of the Roman numeral system is still not a system using place-value as we know it today. To illustrate how difficult computation is without the convenience of proper place-value, determine XCVI + IX + CDIX + CCXXIV (using only Roman numerals in your scratch work)</p>

    <p>In our place-value system, each of the numbers 10, 100, 1000, 10000, …. uses the same two symbols, yet the sizes of the numbers represented grow ten-fold in value. In 1938, Milton Sirotta, nephew of American mathematician Edward Kasner, coined the term “googol” for the number 1 followed by one hundred zeros, and the term “googolplex” for the number 1 followed by a googol zeros. Is the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe smaller or larger than a googolplex?</p>
